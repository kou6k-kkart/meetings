# ðŸ““ KKArt! Meetings & Strategic Decisions Repository

Welcome to the documentation center for **KKArt!**'s weekly meetings.

This repository is designed to archive and track all minutes, plans, and strategic decisions made within the organization. Our goal is to create a transparent and accessible resource to ensure all team members are aligned with the brand's overarching objectives.

Our main organizational meetings are held weekly on **Fridays**, and all related documents are stored in dedicated folders structured by date.
